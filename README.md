  - üì∑ **Camera**: Take photos directly from the app
  - üñºÔ∏è **Photo Library**: Select images from device gallery
  - üìé **Documents**: Upload any file type
  - Preview attachments before sending
  - Remove attachments with one tap

- **Enhanced UI**:
  - Larger, more visible plus icon (36px)
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Attachment previews with file size display
  - Modern modal interface for upload options

### Technical Implementation

- TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Expo Image Picker and Document Picker integration
- Proper permission handling for camera and media library
- Responsive design with consistent spacing
- Theme-aware styling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables (optional)

   For AI-powered message generation, create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   # Google Gemini AI API Key (optional)
   # Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   **Note:** The messaging feature will work without an API key, using fallback messages instead.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Image Caching

The app implements efficient image caching to improve performance and reduce server load:

### Features

- **Automatic Caching**: All remote images are automatically cached locally using `expo-file-system`
- **Background Downloads**: Images are downloaded in the background while showing the original URL
- **Cache Management**: Includes utilities for cache size monitoring and clearing
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallback to original URLs if caching fails

### Components

- **CachedImage**: Drop-in replacement for React Native's Image component with automatic caching
- **Image Cache Utilities**: Located in `utils/imageCache.ts` for manual cache management

### Usage

```tsx
import { CachedImage } from "@/components/ui/CachedImage";

<CachedImage
  source={{ uri: "https://example.com/image.jpg" }}
  style={styles.image}
  showLoader={true}
  fallbackText="Failed to load"
/>;
```

### Testing Image URLs

Run the image URL validation script to ensure all mock data images are working:

```bash
node scripts/testImageUrls.js
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
